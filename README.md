# NEXTHIKE-PROJECT-3
House Price Prediction EDA Project
Introduction and Background
The real estate market is dynamic and complex, making accurate house price prediction crucial for various stakeholders—buyers, sellers, and investors. In this Kaggle project (House Prices — Advanced Regression Techniques), we aim to develop a predictive model that enhances decision-making in the real estate domain. With 79 explanatory variables describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa, our challenge is to predict the final price of each home.

Objectives
Develop a Robust Regression Model: Our primary goal is to create a reliable regression model for predicting house prices.
Effective Outlier Treatment and Feature Engineering: We implement outlier treatment techniques for numerical variables and explore feature engineering methods.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, we visualize data relationships, understand feature distributions, and identify patterns.
Categorical Variable Encoding: We apply encoding methods to handle categorical variables.
Data Normalization/Standardization: We normalize or standardize data using techniques resilient to outliers.
Model Evaluation: We assess model performance using appropriate metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Conclusion
In this comprehensive project, we systematically preprocess and explore the dataset, laying the groundwork for accurate house price predictions.
